# Hand Gesture Recognition System
 Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science and language technology with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms.[1] It is a subdiscipline of computer vision. Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state but commonly originate from the face or hand. Current[when?] focuses in the field include emotion recognition from face and hand gesture recognition. Users can use simple gestures to control or interact with devices without physically touching them. Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language.
